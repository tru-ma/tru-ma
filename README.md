- 👋 Hi, I’m @tru-ma
- My interests are highly varied, my knowledge of most of them is surface-level. My main interest is learning in itself, especially when I have the time and luxury to self-study.
- I hyperfixate on certain subjects to the point of having a deep-level of understanding of them, although it makes me happy, it usually doesn't have daily use.
- Biology is one, the niches are Dogs and Indoor Plants Genetics, I did Reflex Photography for a few years would also play around with image processing apps during that time.
- Psychopathology is a topic I read about a lot, trying to understand the complex relations between how disorders affect the sufferer, their environment and the possible causes of the illnesses.
